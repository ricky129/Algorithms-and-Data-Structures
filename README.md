This project is a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. It serves as a practical library for understanding core computer science concepts, covering everything from simple lists to complex trees and compression algorithms.
Data Structures
The repository contains a wide array of data structure implementations.
Linear Structures: Includes standard implementations of Linked Lists, Stacks (both fixed-size and dynamic), and Queues.
Hierarchical Structures: Features various tree-based structures, including a general Tree, a Binary Search Tree, and a self-balancing AVL Tree. It also provides implementations for Heaps and Priority Queues.
Hash-based Structures: Offers different types of Hash Tables, demonstrating collision resolution techniques like chaining and open addressing.
Dictionaries: Includes a sorted Dictionary class that supports key-value pair storage and efficient searching.
Algorithms
This project also provides implementations for a variety of classic algorithms.
Sorting and Searching: A heapsort algorithm is implemented within the BinaryHeap class. Efficient search algorithms are fundamental to structures like the BinarySearchTree and Dictionary.
Recursion and Divide & Conquer: Classic recursive problems like the Tower of Hanoi are solved. The maximum subarray sum problem is also solved using a divide-and-conquer approach.
Dynamic Programming: This section includes efficient solutions to the Fibonacci sequence and the maximum sum subarray problem.
Data Compression: A complete implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm is provided, allowing for file compression and decompression.
Greedy Algorithms: The classic change-making problem is solved using a greedy approach.
